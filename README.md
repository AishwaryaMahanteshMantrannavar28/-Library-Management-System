## 📝 Task: Database Schema and ER Diagram Design

This project is part of my SQL internship task. It involves designing a relational database schema for a Library Management System using MySQL Workbench.

---

## 📌 Objective
- Learn how to create databases, tables, and define relationships (primary and foreign keys).
- Create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to visualize the schema.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench (for EER diagram and SQL script)
- GitHub (for version control and submission)

| File Name            | Description                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `schema.sql`         | SQL script to create tables and relationships |
| `ER_Diagram.png/pdf` | Visual ER diagram exported from MySQL Workbench |

## 🧩 Tables and Relationships

### Tables:
- `Members` — stores member information
- `Books` — stores book details
- `Borrow` — stores records of borrowed books

### Relationships:
- One `Member` can borrow many `Books`
- Each `Borrow` record links to one `Book` and one `Member`

---

## ✅ Outcome
A well-structured relational database schema with primary and foreign key relationships, visualized through an ER diagram.
